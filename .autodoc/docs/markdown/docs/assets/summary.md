The `highlight.css` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/assets` folder defines CSS variables for the background color of code blocks and sets them based on the user's preferred color scheme. This allows for a consistent and accessible user interface for the mrgn-ts project.

The `:root` selector is used to define the variables `--light-code-background` and `--dark-code-background` with their respective color values. The `@media` rule is then used to set the `--code-background` variable to the appropriate color value based on the user's preferred color scheme. If the user prefers a light color scheme, the `--code-background` variable is set to `--light-code-background`. If the user prefers a dark color scheme, the `--code-background` variable is set to `--dark-code-background`. Finally, the `pre` and `code` selectors are used to set the background color of code blocks to the value of the `--code-background` variable.

This code is likely used in conjunction with other CSS styles to create a consistent and accessible user interface for the mrgn-ts project. For example, the `body.light` and `body.dark` selectors could be used to set the background color of the entire page based on the user's preferred color scheme.

To use this code, simply include the `highlight.css` file in the HTML file and add the appropriate classes to the `body` element to indicate the user's preferred color scheme. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Example Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="mrgn-ts/highlight.css">
</head>
<body class="dark">
  <h1>Example Page</h1>
  <p>This is an example page for the mrgn-ts project.</p>
  <pre><code>const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);</code></pre>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `highlight.css` file is included in the HTML file and the `body` element has a class of `dark`, indicating that the user prefers a dark color scheme. The `pre` and `code` elements within the page will have a background color of `#1E1E1E` (the value of `--dark-code-background`).

Overall, the `highlight.css` file is an important part of creating a consistent and accessible user interface for the mrgn-ts project. By setting the background color of code blocks based on the user's preferred color scheme, this code helps to ensure that all users can easily read and understand the code on the page.
