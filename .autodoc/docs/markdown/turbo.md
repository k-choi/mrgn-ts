This code is a configuration file for a pipeline that is part of the mrgn-ts project. The pipeline consists of several stages, each with its own set of configurations. 

The first stage is "clean", which has a cache property set to false. This stage is responsible for cleaning up any previous build artifacts before starting a new build. 

The second stage is "build", which depends on the "^build" task and has two outputs: "dist/**" and ".next/**". This stage is responsible for building the project and generating the necessary artifacts. 

The third stage is "lint", which has an empty outputs array. This stage is responsible for running linting checks on the codebase. 

The fourth stage is "dev", which has a cache property set to false. This stage is responsible for running the project in development mode. 

The fifth and final stage is "start", which also has a cache property set to false. This stage is responsible for starting the project in production mode. 

The "globalEnv" property is an array of environment variables that are used throughout the project. These variables include NODE_ENV, NEXT_PUBLIC_MARGINFI_ENVIRONMENT, NEXT_PUBLIC_MARGINFI_RPC_ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE, and others. 

Overall, this configuration file defines the pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the mrgn-ts project. It provides a standardized way of building and deploying the project across different environments and ensures that the project is built and deployed consistently. 

Example usage:

To run the "build" stage of the pipeline, you can use the following command:

```
turbo build build
```

This will run the "build" stage and generate the necessary artifacts for the project. 

To run the "dev" stage of the pipeline, you can use the following command:

```
turbo dev
```

This will start the project in development mode. 

To start the project in production mode, you can use the following command:

```
turbo start
```

This will start the project in production mode.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file is defining a pipeline for a build process, including steps for cleaning, building, and linting.

2. What is the significance of the "^build" dependency in the "build" step?
   - The "^build" dependency indicates that the "build" step should only run after any other steps with a name that starts with "build" have completed.

3. What are the global environment variables being defined?
   - The global environment variables being defined include various settings related to authentication, as well as settings specific to the "MARGINFI" and "ANCHOR" projects.
