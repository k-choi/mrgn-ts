This code defines several constants that are likely used throughout the mrgn-ts project.

The first four constants define seed values for various vaults in a bank. These seeds are represented as Buffers, which are Node.js's way of handling binary data. The names of the seeds suggest that they are used for authentication purposes, likely to ensure that only authorized users can access the vaults.

The last two constants define the number of price intervals for a Pyth price configuration and the number of decimal places for USDC. Pyth is a decentralized price oracle that provides real-time price data for various assets. The number of price intervals is represented as a BigNumber, which is a library for handling large numbers in JavaScript. The number of decimal places for USDC is a standard value used in the cryptocurrency world.

These constants are likely used throughout the mrgn-ts project to ensure consistency and avoid hardcoding values. For example, the seed values could be used to generate public keys for the vaults, while the Pyth and USDC constants could be used in calculations involving those assets.

Here is an example of how the USDC_DECIMALS constant could be used:

```
import { USDC_DECIMALS } from "mrgn-ts";

const usdcAmount = 1000000; // 1 USDC represented as an integer
const usdcDecimalAmount = usdcAmount / 10 ** USDC_DECIMALS; // convert to decimal representation
console.log(usdcDecimalAmount); // output: 1
```

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of the `BigNumber` import and how is it used in this code?

- `BigNumber` is likely used for handling large decimal numbers with precision. It is used to set the value of `PYTH_PRICE_CONF_INTERVALS`.

2. What is the significance of the `Buffer.from` calls and how are they used?
   - The `Buffer.from` calls are used to create byte buffers from string values. They are used to set the values of the various `PDA_BANK_*_AUTH_SEED` and `PDA_BANK_*_VAULT_SEED` constants.
3. What is the purpose of the `USDC_DECIMALS` constant and how is it used?
   - `USDC_DECIMALS` likely represents the number of decimal places for the USDC stablecoin. It is used to handle conversions and calculations involving USDC amounts.
