The `mrgn-ts` project contains a module that exports functions to retrieve configuration data for the Marginfi application. The module imports the `PublicKey` class from the `@solana/web3.js` library and several types from a `types` module. It also imports the `array`, `assert`, `enums`, `Infer`, `object`, and `string` functions from the `superstruct` library, and a JSON object containing configuration data from a `configs.json` file.

The `BankConfigRaw` constant is defined as a `superstruct` object that has a `label` property of type `string` and an `address` property of type `string`. The `MarginfiConfigRaw` constant is defined as a `superstruct` object that has a `label` property of type `enums` that can have one of six string values, a `cluster` property of type `string`, a `program` property of type `string`, a `group` property of type `string`, and a `banks` property of type `array` that contains objects of type `BankConfigRaw`. The `ConfigRaw` constant is defined as an array of objects of type `MarginfiConfigRaw`.

The `parseBankConfig` function takes an object of type `BankConfigRaw` and returns an object of type `BankAddress` that has a `label` property that is the same as the input object's `label` property and an `address` property that is a new `PublicKey` instance created from the input object's `address` property.

The `parseConfig` function takes an object of type `MarginfiConfigRaw` and returns an object of type `MarginfiConfig` that has an `environment` property that is the same as the input object's `label` property, a `cluster` property that is the same as the input object's `cluster` property, a `programId` property that is a new `PublicKey` instance created from the input object's `program` property, a `groupPk` property that is a new `PublicKey` instance created from the input object's `group` property, and a `banks` property that is an array of objects of type `BankAddress` created by calling the `parseBankConfig` function on each object in the input object's `banks` property.

The `parseConfigs` function takes an array of objects of type `MarginfiConfigRaw` and returns an object that has keys that are the same as the `label` properties of the input objects and values that are objects of type `MarginfiConfig` created by calling the `parseConfig` function on each input object.

The `loadDefaultConfig` function asserts that the `configs` constant contains an array of objects of type `MarginfiConfigRaw` and returns an object that has keys that are the same as the `label` properties of the input objects and values that are objects of type `MarginfiConfig` created by calling the `parseConfig` function on each input object.

The `getMarginfiConfig` function takes an `environment` argument of type `Environment` and an optional `overrides` argument of type `Partial<Omit<MarginfiConfig, "environment">>` and returns an object of type `MarginfiConfig` that is either the default configuration for the input `environment` or a configuration that overrides some of the default values with the values in the `overrides` argument.

The `getConfig` function takes an optional `environment` argument of type `Environment` and an optional `overrides` argument of type `Partial<Omit<MarginfiConfig, "environment">>` and returns an object of type `MarginfiConfig` that is either the default configuration for the input `environment` or a configuration that overrides some of the default values with the values in the `overrides` argument. This function is the main interface for retrieving configuration data for the Marginfi application.

Overall, this module provides a way to retrieve configuration data for the Marginfi application based on the current environment. The `getConfig` function can be called with an optional `environment` argument to retrieve the default configuration for that environment, or with an optional `overrides` argument to override some of the default values. The `loadDefaultConfig` function reads configuration data from a JSON file and parses it into an object that can be used by the `getConfig` function. The `parseConfigs`, `parseConfig`, and `parseBankConfig` functions are used to parse the configuration data into the appropriate types.

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of the `types` module that is imported?

- A smart developer might wonder what types are defined in the `types` module that is imported, and how they are used in this code.

2. What is the format of the `configs.json` file that is imported?

- A smart developer might want to know the structure of the `configs.json` file that is imported, and what information it contains.

3. What is the purpose of the `parseConfigs` function?

- A smart developer might wonder what the `parseConfigs` function does, and how it is used in the code.
