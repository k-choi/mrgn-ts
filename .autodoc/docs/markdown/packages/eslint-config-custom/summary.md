The `index.js` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/packages/eslint-config-custom` folder exports an object that contains configuration settings and linting rules for the mrgn-ts project. The object extends three different configurations: "next", "turbo", and "prettier". The "next" configuration likely refers to the Next.js framework, while the "prettier" configuration enforces consistent code style across the project. The "turbo" configuration is specific to the mrgn-ts project.

The object also includes a set of rules that override or disable certain linting rules. For example, the "@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages" rule is turned off, which suggests that the project may use HTML links for page navigation instead of Next.js's built-in routing system. The "react/jsx-key" rule is also turned off, which allows for the use of JSX without specifying a unique "key" prop for each element in a list.

The "react-hooks" rules are set to "error" and "warn", respectively. This likely means that the project enforces the use of React hooks and warns developers when they may have missed a dependency in a useEffect hook.

To use this configuration object in a Next.js project's `package.json` file, developers can add the following code:

```
{
  "name": "my-next-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^11.1.2",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "./node_modules/mrgn-ts"
    ]
  }
}
```

This code sets up a set of configuration settings and linting rules for the mrgn-ts project, ensuring consistent code style and enforcing certain best practices for React development. It can be used in conjunction with other parts of the project, such as the Next.js framework and React hooks, to create a cohesive and well-structured application.
