This code exports various modules from the `mrgn-ts` project, including constants, types, miscellaneous functions, conversion utilities, accounting tools, and a module called `spl`. Additionally, it exports a class called `NodeWallet` from a file called `nodeWallet`.

The purpose of this code is to make these modules and the `NodeWallet` class available for use in other parts of the `mrgn-ts` project or in other projects that import this code. By exporting these modules and class, other developers can easily access and utilize the functionality provided by these modules without having to write their own implementations.

For example, if a developer wanted to use the `NodeWallet` class in another part of the project, they could simply import it like this:

```
import { NodeWallet } from "mrgn-ts";
```

Similarly, if they needed to use any of the constants, types, or utility functions provided by the other modules, they could import them in the same way.

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and make available various pieces of functionality within the `mrgn-ts` project, allowing for easier development and maintenance of the project as a whole.

## Questions:

1. **What is the purpose of the `NodeWallet` import?**
   The `NodeWallet` import is used in this file, but it is not clear what it is used for or how it is used in the project.

2. **What are the contents of the exported modules?**
   The file exports multiple modules, including `constants`, `types`, `misc`, `conversion`, `accounting`, and `spl`. It is not clear what each of these modules contains or how they are used in the project.

3. **Why is `NodeWallet` exported separately from the other modules?**
   It is not clear why `NodeWallet` is exported separately from the other modules. It may have a unique purpose or be used in a different way than the other modules.
