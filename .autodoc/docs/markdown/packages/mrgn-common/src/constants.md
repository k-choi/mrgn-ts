This file contains several constants and types that are used throughout the mrgn-ts project.

The first three constants define default options for sending and confirming transactions on the Solana blockchain using the `@solana/web3.js` library.

`DEFAULT_COMMITMENT` is a type of `Commitment` that specifies the level of commitment that should be used when sending or confirming transactions. In this case, the default is set to "processed", which means that the transaction will be considered final once it has been processed by the network.

`DEFAULT_SEND_OPTS` is a type of `SendOptions` that specifies additional options for sending transactions. The `skipPreflight` option is set to `false`, which means that the transaction will be checked for errors before being sent. The `preflightCommitment` option is set to `DEFAULT_COMMITMENT`, which means that the level of commitment used during preflight checks will be the same as the level of commitment used during confirmation.

`DEFAULT_CONFIRM_OPTS` is a type of `ConfirmOptions` that specifies options for confirming transactions. The `commitment` option is set to `DEFAULT_COMMITMENT`, which means that the level of commitment used during confirmation will be the same as the level of commitment used during preflight checks. The `...DEFAULT_SEND_OPTS` syntax spreads the `DEFAULT_SEND_OPTS` object into `DEFAULT_CONFIRM_OPTS`, so that all of the options specified in `DEFAULT_SEND_OPTS` are also included in `DEFAULT_CONFIRM_OPTS`.

The final constant, `USDC_DECIMALS`, is a number that represents the number of decimal places used by the USDC stablecoin. This constant is used throughout the mrgn-ts project to convert between USDC amounts and their equivalent amounts in other currencies or tokens.

Overall, this file provides default options and constants that are used throughout the mrgn-ts project to interact with the Solana blockchain and perform calculations involving USDC. Developers working on the project can use these constants and types to simplify their code and ensure consistency across different parts of the project.

Example usage:

```
import { DEFAULT_CONFIRM_OPTS, USDC_DECIMALS } from "mrgn-ts";

// Use DEFAULT_CONFIRM_OPTS to confirm a transaction
await connection.confirmTransaction(txHash, DEFAULT_CONFIRM_OPTS);

// Convert a USDC amount to a SOL amount
const usdcAmount = 100;
const solAmount = usdcAmount / (10 ** USDC_DECIMALS);
```

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of the `mrgn-ts` project?

- As a code documentation expert, I do not have enough information to answer this question. The code provided only shows a few constants and imports from the `@solana/web3.js` library.

2. What is the significance of the `DEFAULT_COMMITMENT` constant?

- The `DEFAULT_COMMITMENT` constant is of type `Commitment` and is set to the string value "processed". It is likely used as a default value for a parameter that requires a `Commitment` type.

3. What is the purpose of the `USDC_DECIMALS` constant?

- The `USDC_DECIMALS` constant is set to the integer value 6. It is likely used to represent the number of decimal places for the USDC cryptocurrency, which is commonly used in the Solana blockchain ecosystem.
