The `lip-client` folder in the `mrgn-ts` project contains code related to the client-side of the project. One of the subfolders in this folder is the `components` folder, which contains reusable React components that can be used throughout the project.

The `components` folder contains several subfolders, each with its own set of React components. For example, the `common` folder contains components that are used across the project, such as buttons and input fields. The `dashboard` folder contains components that are specific to the project's dashboard, such as charts and graphs.

Each component is defined in its own TypeScript file, with the file name matching the name of the component. The code in each file exports a React component that can be imported and used in other parts of the project.

For example, to use the `Button` component from the `common` folder, you would import it like this:

```
import { Button } from '../components/common/Button';
```

You can then use the `Button` component in your code like any other React component:

```
<Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>Click me</Button>
```

The `components` folder is an important part of the `mrgn-ts` project, as it provides a library of reusable React components that can be used throughout the project. By organizing the components into subfolders based on their purpose, it makes it easier for developers to find the components they need and reduces the amount of code duplication in the project.

Overall, the `components` folder is a crucial part of the `mrgn-ts` project's client-side codebase, providing a library of reusable React components that can be used throughout the project.
