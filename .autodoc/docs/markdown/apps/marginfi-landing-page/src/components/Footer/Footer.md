[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/mrgnlabs/mrgn-ts/apps/marginfi-landing-page/src/components/Footer/Footer.tsx)

The code defines a React functional component called `Footer` that renders a fixed navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. The navigation bar consists of three sections: the left section contains links to the MarginFi documentation, analytics, and GitHub pages; the middle section contains a single link to the MarginFi decentralized lending and borrowing protocol; and the right section contains links to the MarginFi Twitter and Telegram pages, as well as a disabled link to the MRGN, Inc. website.

The navigation bar is implemented using the `Link` component from the Next.js framework, which allows for client-side navigation without a full page refresh. Each link is wrapped in a `NavbarCenterItem` component, which is not defined in this file but is presumably imported from another module. The `NavbarCenterItem` component renders a styled button with the text of the link.

The middle section of the navigation bar is hidden on small screens and only appears on screens larger than the "lg" breakpoint. It consists of a single link to the MarginFi protocol wrapped in a `NavbarCenterItem` component.

The `Footer` component is exported from the module and can be imported and used in other parts of the project. It is likely intended to be included in the layout of multiple pages to provide consistent navigation across the site.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { Footer } from "mrgn-ts/Footer";

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* page content */}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the project?

- This code defines a React functional component called `Footer` that renders a fixed navigation bar at the bottom of the page. It is likely used as a common footer component across multiple pages of the `mrgn-ts` project.

2. What external libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?

- This code imports several external libraries and frameworks, including `react`, `next/link`, `next/image`, and `@mui/material`. It also imports a custom CSS module called `Footer.module.css`.

3. What is the purpose of the `NavbarCenterItem` and `Button` components, and where are they defined?

- The `NavbarCenterItem` component is a custom component that is likely defined elsewhere in the project. It is used to render a clickable link with a text label in the center of the navigation bar. The `Button` component is imported from the `@mui/material` library but is not actually used in this code.
