This code defines the styling for two buttons: `.wallet-button` and `.airdrop-button`. These buttons are likely used in the user interface of the mrgn-ts project.

The `.wallet-button` class sets the height, width, font size, color, background color, border, padding, border radius, display, justify content, align items, font weight, and text transform properties for the button. The button has a gray background color and black text color, with a rounded border. The text is centered within the button.

The `.airdrop-button` class sets the background color, text color, border, padding, height, and border radius properties for the button. The button has a greenish background color with low opacity, and white text color. The button has a rounded border and is slightly taller than the `.wallet-button`.

The `.airdrop-button:hover` class sets the font weight, background color, text color, border, and border radius properties for the button when the user hovers over it. The button becomes bold, the background color becomes transparent, the text color becomes white, and the border becomes white. The border radius remains the same.

Overall, this code defines the visual appearance of two buttons that are likely used in the user interface of the mrgn-ts project. The `.wallet-button` is a gray button with black text, while the `.airdrop-button` is a greenish button with white text. When the user hovers over the `.airdrop-button`, it becomes bold and the colors invert.
