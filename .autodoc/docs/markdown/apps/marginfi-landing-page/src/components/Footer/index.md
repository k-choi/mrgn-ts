This code exports the `Footer` component from the `Footer.ts` file located in the same directory. The purpose of this code is to make the `Footer` component available for use in other parts of the project.

By exporting the `Footer` component, other files in the project can import and use it. For example, if there is a `HomePage` component that needs to display a footer, it can import the `Footer` component from this file and render it in the `HomePage` component.

Here is an example of how this code can be used in another file:

```
import React from "react";
import { Footer } from "./path/to/Footer";

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the HomePage</h1>
      <p>This is the content of the HomePage</p>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

In this example, the `HomePage` component imports the `Footer` component from the `Footer.ts` file and renders it at the bottom of the page.

Overall, this code plays an important role in the larger project by allowing components to be reused and shared across different parts of the application.

## Questions:

1. **What is the purpose of this file?**\
   A smart developer might wonder what this file is responsible for within the `mrgn-ts` project. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting the `Footer` component from a separate file.

2. **Where is the `Footer` component being imported from?**\
   A smart developer might want to know where the `Footer` component is defined and implemented. Based on the code, it is being imported from a file located in the same directory as this file.

3. **Why is only the `Footer` component being exported?**\
   A smart developer might question why only the `Footer` component is being exported from this file. They may wonder if there are other components or modules that should also be exported. Without more context, it is unclear why only the `Footer` component is being exported.
