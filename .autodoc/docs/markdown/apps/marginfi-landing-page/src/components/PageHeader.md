The code defines a React functional component called `PageHeader` that returns a header section for a web page. The component uses the `FC` type from the `react` library to define the props that the component accepts. The component returns a `div` element that contains a header with the text "mrgnlend". The header is styled using CSS classes that are defined inline using template literals. The `className` attribute of the `div` element contains a combination of fixed and dynamic classes that define the layout, font, and background image of the header.

The purpose of this code is to provide a reusable header component that can be used across different pages of a web application. The component can be imported into other React components and used as a child element to display a consistent header across the application. For example, a `HomePage` component could import the `PageHeader` component and use it as follows:

```
import { PageHeader } from "mrgn-ts";

const HomePage: FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <PageHeader />
      <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>
      <p>This is the home page.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `HomePage` component renders the `PageHeader` component followed by a heading and a paragraph. The `PageHeader` component provides a visually consistent header across all pages of the application, while the `HomePage` component provides the specific content for the home page.

Overall, this code demonstrates how React components can be used to create reusable UI elements that can be composed together to build complex web applications. By defining a consistent header component, the application can provide a unified user experience across all pages.

## Questions:

1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a React functional component called `PageHeader` that renders a header with a background image and the text "mrgnlend".

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   This code imports the `FC` type from the `react` library.

3. What styling is applied to the header?
   The header has a solid border with a color of `#1C2125`, a height of `80px`, and a background image specified by the URL `/WaveBG3.png`. It also has a custom font (`font-aeonik`) and font size (`text-3xl`), and is centered horizontally with some padding on the left.
