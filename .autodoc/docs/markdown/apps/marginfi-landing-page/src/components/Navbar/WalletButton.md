This code defines a React component called `WalletButton` that renders a button for connecting to a Solana wallet. The component uses the `useWallet` hook from the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` library to get the current wallet connection status. If the wallet is not connected, the button displays the text "CONNECT".

The component also uses the `next/dynamic` function to dynamically import the `WalletMultiButton` component from the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` library. This is done to prevent server-side rendering (SSR) of the component, which can cause issues with client-side rendering.

The `WalletButton` component renders the `WalletMultiButton` component with a custom class name and an image of a wallet icon as the start icon. The image is loaded using the `next/image` component, which optimizes the image for performance.

This component can be used in a larger project that requires integration with Solana wallets. Developers can import the `WalletButton` component and render it in their application to provide a user-friendly way for users to connect their wallets.

Example usage:

```
import { WalletButton } from "mrgn-ts";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Solana app</h1>
      <WalletButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of the `dynamic` import and how does it work?

- The `dynamic` import is used to asynchronously load a component from the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` package. It works by returning a Promise that resolves to the component when it is ready to be rendered.

2. What is the `WalletButton` component and what does it do?

   - The `WalletButton` component is a functional component that renders a dynamic `WalletMultiButton` component from the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` package. It also uses the `useWallet` hook from the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` package to get the current wallet state.

3. Why is the `ssr` option set to `false` in the `dynamic` import?
   - The `ssr` option is set to `false` to prevent the `WalletMultiButton` component from being rendered on the server side. This is because the `useWallet` hook relies on client-side browser APIs that are not available on the server.
