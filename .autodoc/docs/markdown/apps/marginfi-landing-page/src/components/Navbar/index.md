This code exports the `Navbar` component from the `Navbar.ts` file located in the same directory. The purpose of this code is to make the `Navbar` component available for use in other parts of the project.

The `Navbar` component is likely a reusable UI component that provides navigation functionality for the application. By exporting it from this file, other components or modules in the project can import and use it as needed.

For example, if there is a `Header` component that needs to include a navigation bar, it can import the `Navbar` component from this file and render it within the `Header` component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Navbar } from "./mrgn-ts";

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <Navbar />
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and modularize the project's components, making them easier to manage and reuse throughout the application.

## Questions:

1. **What is the purpose of this file?**\
   A smart developer might wonder what this file is responsible for within the `mrgn-ts` project. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting the `Navbar` component from a separate file.

2. **Where is the `Navbar` component defined?**\
   A smart developer might want to know where the `Navbar` component is defined in order to understand its functionality and how it fits into the project. It is possible that it is defined in the same directory as this file, or in a different directory that is being imported.

3. **What other components or modules are being exported from this project?**\
   A smart developer might be interested in knowing what other components or modules are being exported from the `mrgn-ts` project. This file only exports the `Navbar` component, but there may be other files that export additional functionality.
