This code exports two components, `Footer` and `Navbar`, from their respective files located in the `mrgn-ts` project. These components are likely part of a larger web application or website and are used to display a footer and navigation bar respectively.

By exporting these components, other files within the project can import and use them as needed. For example, a file that renders the entire web application may import and use the `Navbar` component to display a navigation bar at the top of the page.

Here is an example of how these components may be used in a React application:

```
import React from "react";
import { Navbar, Footer } from "./components";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>Some content here...</p>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Navbar` and `Footer` components are imported from the `components` directory and used within the `App` component to display a navigation bar at the top of the page and a footer at the bottom.

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and export reusable components within the `mrgn-ts` project, making it easier for other files to import and use them as needed.

## Questions:

1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\
   A smart developer might wonder what this code file is responsible for and how it fits into the overall project structure. This code file exports the `Footer` and `Navbar` components from their respective files, indicating that it is likely a module for exporting commonly used components.

2. **What other components or modules depend on these exports?**\
   A smart developer might want to know which other components or modules in the project rely on the `Footer` and `Navbar` exports. This information could help them understand the impact of any changes made to these components or modules.

3. **Are there any other exports or functionality in these component files?**\
   A smart developer might be curious if there are any other exports or functionality in the `Footer` and `Navbar` component files that are not being exported in this code file. This information could help them understand the full capabilities of these components and how they can be used in the project.
