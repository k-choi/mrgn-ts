This code defines an array of objects that represent different tokens on the Solana blockchain. Each object contains information about a specific token, such as its address, chain ID, decimals, name, symbol, logo URI, and coingecko ID.

The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for storing information about different tokens that are used within the mrgn-ts project. This information can be used by other parts of the project to interact with these tokens, such as querying their balances or transferring them between accounts.

For example, if a user wants to transfer some Wrapped SOL tokens to another account, they would need to know the token's address and decimals. This information can be obtained from the object in the array that corresponds to Wrapped SOL.

```
const wrappedSol = tokens.find(token => token.symbol === 'SOL');
const transferAmount = 1000000000; // 1 Wrapped SOL
const recipientAddress = 'So22222222222222222222222222222222222222222';

// Transfer Wrapped SOL to recipient
await connection.sendTransaction(
  new Transaction().add(
    SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: wallet.publicKey,
      toPubkey: new PublicKey(recipientAddress),
      lamports: transferAmount,
    })
  ),
  [wallet],
  { skipPreflight: false, preflightCommitment: 'singleGossip' }
);
```

Overall, this code serves as a useful reference for developers working on the mrgn-ts project who need to interact with different tokens on the Solana blockchain. By centralizing this information in one place, it helps to reduce errors and improve code maintainability.

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of this code?

This code defines a list of tokens with their respective attributes such as name, symbol, address, and logo URI.

2. What blockchain network is this code intended for?

   This code is intended for the blockchain network with chain ID 101.

3. What is the significance of the "extensions" field in each token object?

   The "extensions" field contains additional information about the token, such as its ID on the Coingecko platform.
