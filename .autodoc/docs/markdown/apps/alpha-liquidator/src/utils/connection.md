This code is a module that exports a `connection` object used to connect to a Solana blockchain node. It uses the `@solana/web3.js` library to create a `Connection` object and sets the `commitment` level to "confirmed". It also uses the `fetch-retry` library to create a `fetchWithRetry` function that retries failed HTTP requests up to 3 times with a delay of 100ms between retries. Finally, it exports a `connection` object that is created by calling the `createConnection` function.

The `connection` object can be used to interact with the Solana blockchain node, such as querying account balances, sending transactions, and subscribing to events. The `commitment` level determines how many confirmations a transaction needs before it is considered final. Setting it to "confirmed" means that the transaction must be included in a confirmed block.

The `fetchWithRetry` function is used to make HTTP requests to the Solana node. It retries failed requests up to 3 times to handle temporary network errors. This is important because Solana transactions are time-sensitive and need to be processed quickly.

The `createConnection` function creates a new `Connection` object with the specified `RPC_ENDPOINT` and `commitment` level. It also sets the `fetch` option to use the `fetchWithRetry` function. This ensures that all HTTP requests made by the `Connection` object are retried if they fail.

Here is an example of how this module can be used:

```typescript
import { connection } from "mrgn-ts";

async function getBalance(publicKey: PublicKey): Promise<number> {
  const balance = await connection.getBalance(publicKey, commitment);
  return balance;
}
```

In this example, the `getBalance` function uses the `connection` object to query the balance of a Solana account identified by `publicKey`. The `commitment` level is passed as an argument to ensure that the balance is final and confirmed. The function returns the account balance as a number.

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of the `Commitment` and `Connection` imports from `@solana/web3.js`?

- The `Commitment` and `Connection` imports are likely used for interacting with the Solana blockchain network.

2. What is the purpose of the `fetchRetry` and `fetch` imports?

- The `fetchRetry` and `fetch` imports are likely used for making HTTP requests, with `fetchRetry` providing retry functionality.

3. What is the purpose of the `env_config` import from "../config"?

- The `env_config` import is likely used for accessing environment variables or configuration settings specific to the project.
