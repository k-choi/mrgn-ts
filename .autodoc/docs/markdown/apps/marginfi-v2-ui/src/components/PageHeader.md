The code defines a React functional component called `PageHeader` that returns a header section for a web page. The component is exported for use in other parts of the project.

The header section is contained within a `div` element with a class name of "hidden sm:flex w-full flex-row justify-center border-solid border-[#1C2125] border-y-[1px]". This class name applies CSS styles to the `div` element, including making it a flex container that is horizontally centered and has a solid border at the top and bottom of 1 pixel width. The "hidden sm:flex" part of the class name means that the element is hidden on small screens but displayed as a flex container on larger screens.

Inside the `div` element, there is another `div` element that contains the actual header content. This `div` element has a class name that applies CSS styles to it, including setting its height to 80 pixels, its width to 90% of its parent element's width, and its maximum width to 7xl (a custom size). It also sets the left padding to 60 pixels, aligns its child elements vertically centered, and applies a custom font and font size. The background of the `div` element is set to an image file called "WaveBG3.png" using a URL.

The text "mrgnlend" is displayed inside the inner `div` element as the header content.

This component can be used in other parts of the project by importing it and rendering it as a JSX element. For example:

```
import { PageHeader } from "mrgn-ts";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PageHeader />
      <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This would render the `PageHeader` component followed by a paragraph element containing the text "Welcome to my website!".
