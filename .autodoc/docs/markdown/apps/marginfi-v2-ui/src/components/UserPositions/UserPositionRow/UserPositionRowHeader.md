[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/mrgnlabs/mrgn-ts/apps/marginfi-v2-ui/src/components/UserPositions/UserPositionRow/UserPositionRowHeader.tsx)

The code defines a React functional component called `UserPositionRowHeader` that renders a table cell containing an asset name and an optional icon. The component takes two props: `assetName`, which is a string representing the name of the asset to be displayed, and `icon`, which is an optional string representing the URL of an image to be displayed alongside the asset name.

The component uses the `TableCell` component from the Material-UI library to render a table cell. It also uses the `Image` component from the Next.js library to render the optional icon. The component applies some custom styles to the table cell and the elements inside it using CSS classes.

The `UserPositionRowHeader` component is likely used in a larger project to render a table row header for a user's position in relation to an asset. The component could be used in conjunction with other components to build a table that displays information about multiple assets and their associated users. Here is an example of how the component might be used:

```
import { Table, TableBody, TableRow } from "@mui/material";
import { UserPositionRowHeader } from "mrgn-ts";

const AssetTable = ({ assets }) => (
  <Table>
    <TableBody>
      {assets.map((asset) => (
        <TableRow key={asset.id}>
          <UserPositionRowHeader assetName={asset.name} icon={asset.iconUrl} />
          {/* other table cells for displaying asset information */}
        </TableRow>
      ))}
    </TableBody>
  </Table>
);
```

In this example, the `AssetTable` component takes an array of asset objects as a prop and maps over them to render a table row for each asset. The `UserPositionRowHeader` component is used to render the header cell for each row, passing in the asset name and icon URL from the current asset object.

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of this code?

- This code defines a React component called `UserPositionRowHeader` that renders a table cell with an asset name and an optional icon.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?

   - This code imports `TableCell` from the `@mui/material` library, `Image` from the `next/image` library, and `FC` (FunctionComponent) from the `react` library.

3. What styling or layout properties are applied to the rendered component?
   - The rendered component has a minimum width of 90 pixels, is horizontally aligned to the start of the table cell, and has a gap of 1 between its child elements. It also applies conditional styling based on whether an icon is provided, such as changing the flex direction, alignment, and justification. The asset name text is styled with the "Aeonik Pro" font and a font weight of 400.
