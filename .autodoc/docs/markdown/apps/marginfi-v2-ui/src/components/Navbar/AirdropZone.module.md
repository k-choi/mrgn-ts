The code provided is a CSS file that defines the styling for a web page. The purpose of this code is to define the layout and appearance of various elements on the page, such as the container, overlay, title, description, table, and buttons.

The container element is positioned absolutely in the center of the page using the `top`, `left`, and `transform` properties. It has a background color defined by a linear gradient, a border radius, and a maximum width of 400 pixels. The font family, weight, and size are also defined for the container.

The overlay element is a full-screen background image with padding and a background color defined by the `background-image`, `padding`, and `background-color` properties. It is set to display as a flex container with a column direction and centered alignment.

The title element is centered within the container and has a font size of 25 pixels. The description element is a column flex container with a margin-top of 40 pixels and a gap of 5 pixels between its child elements. The table element is centered within the container and has a width of 60%, with a font weight and line height defined.

The special-row and second-row elements are flex containers with row direction and centered alignment. The link-text element is also a flex container with row direction and centered alignment, but with a margin-top of 50 pixels. The copy-link element is a flex container with centered alignment and a gap of 20 pixels between its child elements.

Finally, the action-button-disabled class is defined with a background color of #6d6d6d, which is used to style disabled buttons on the page.

Overall, this code defines the visual appearance of various elements on a web page, allowing for a consistent and visually appealing user interface. It can be used in conjunction with other code files to create a complete web application.
