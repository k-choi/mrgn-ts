[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/mrgnlabs/mrgn-ts/apps/marginfi-v2-ui/src/components/Navbar/index.tsx)

This code exports the `Navbar` component from the `Navbar.ts` file located in the `mrgn-ts` project. The purpose of this code is to make the `Navbar` component available for use in other parts of the project.

The `Navbar` component is likely a reusable UI component that provides navigation functionality for the application. By exporting it from this file, other parts of the project can import and use it as needed.

For example, if there is a `Header` component that needs to include a navigation menu, it can import the `Navbar` component like this:

```
import { Navbar } from "mrgn-ts";

function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Navbar />
    </header>
  );
}
```

This code assumes that the `mrgn-ts` package has been installed in the project and that the `Navbar` component has been exported from the `Navbar.ts` file.

Overall, this code is a simple example of how components can be exported and imported in a TypeScript project. By breaking down the application into reusable components, developers can create more modular and maintainable code.

## Questions:

1. **What is the purpose of this file?**\
   A smart developer might wonder what this file does and how it fits into the overall project structure. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting the `Navbar` component from the `Navbar.ts` file.

2. **What is the `Navbar` component used for?**\
   A smart developer might want to know more about the `Navbar` component and how it is used within the project. Without additional context, it is unclear what functionality the `Navbar` component provides.

3. **Are there any other components or modules that are exported from this file?**\
   A smart developer might want to know if there are any other exports from this file besides the `Navbar` component. Based on the code, it appears that only the `Navbar` component is being exported, but it is possible that there could be other exports that are not shown in this code snippet.
