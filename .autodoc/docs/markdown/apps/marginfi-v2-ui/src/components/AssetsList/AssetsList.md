The `AssetsList` component is a React functional component that renders a list of assets. It imports several hooks and components from external libraries and other files in the project.

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of whether the user is in lending mode or not. It also uses the `useProgram`, `useBanks`, `useUserAccounts`, and `useWallet` hooks to retrieve data from the Solana blockchain and the user's wallet.

The component renders a `BorrowLendToggle` component that allows the user to switch between borrowing and lending modes. It also renders a `Card` component that contains a `TableContainer` component, which in turn contains a `Table` component. The `Table` component renders a list of `AssetRow` components, one for each asset in the user's account.

The `AssetRow` component displays information about the asset, such as its name, symbol, balance, and value. It also displays buttons that allow the user to deposit, withdraw, borrow, or repay the asset. The component uses the `marginfiClient` object to interact with the Solana program that manages the assets.

If the `extendedBankInfos` array is empty, the component renders a `LoadingAssets` component that displays a skeleton loading animation. The `LoadingAssets` component renders a table row with a `Skeleton` component for each asset.

Overall, the `AssetsList` component provides a user interface for managing assets on the Solana blockchain. It allows the user to view their assets, switch between borrowing and lending modes, and perform various actions on their assets. The component is part of a larger project called `mrgn-ts` and is likely used in conjunction with other components and modules to provide a complete user experience.

2. What is the purpose of the `LoadingAssets` component?

- The `LoadingAssets` component is responsible for rendering a skeleton loading state for the asset rows while the data is being fetched.

3. What external libraries or dependencies are being used in this file?
