The code above is a simple export statement that exports the `AssetRow` class from the `AssetRow.ts` file located in the `mrgn-ts` project.

The `AssetRow` class is likely a component that is used to render a row of data related to an asset in the larger project. It may contain various properties and methods that allow for the customization and manipulation of the data being displayed.

By exporting the `AssetRow` class from the `AssetRow.ts` file, it can be imported and used in other parts of the project where it is needed. For example, if there is a table component that displays a list of assets, the `AssetRow` component can be used to render each row of data in the table.

Here is an example of how the `AssetRow` component may be used in another file within the `mrgn-ts` project:

```
import AssetRow from "./AssetRow";

const assets = [
  { name: "Asset 1", value: 100 },
  { name: "Asset 2", value: 200 },
  { name: "Asset 3", value: 300 }
];

function AssetTable() {
  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {assets.map(asset => (
          <AssetRow key={asset.name} name={asset.name} value={asset.value} />
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
}
```

In the example above, the `AssetRow` component is imported and used within the `AssetTable` component to render each row of data in the table. The `assets` array contains the data to be displayed, and the `map` function is used to iterate over each item in the array and render an `AssetRow` component for each one.

Overall, the `AssetRow` component is a reusable piece of code that can be used throughout the `mrgn-ts` project to render rows of data related to assets.

## Questions:

1. **What is the purpose of the `AssetRow` module?**\
   A smart developer might wonder what functionality the `AssetRow` module provides and how it is used within the `mrgn-ts` project.

2. **Why is the `AssetRow` module being exported as the default export?**\
   A smart developer might question why the `AssetRow` module is being exported as the default export instead of a named export, and whether this has any implications for how it is used in other parts of the project.

3. **What other modules or components does the `AssetRow` module depend on?**\
   A smart developer might want to know if the `AssetRow` module has any dependencies on other modules or components within the `mrgn-ts` project, and whether any changes to those dependencies could affect the behavior of the `AssetRow` module.
