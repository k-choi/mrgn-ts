This code is a license for a font called "Plex" that is being used in the mrgn-ts project. The license is the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, which allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified, and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

This license is important for the mrgn-ts project because it ensures that the font being used is licensed appropriately and can be used freely without any legal issues. It also allows for modifications to be made to the font if necessary, which can be useful for customizing the font to fit the needs of the project.

Example usage of this license in the mrgn-ts project would be to include the license file in the project's repository and ensure that any use of the "Plex" font follows the guidelines outlined in the license. This can be done by including the copyright notice and license in any documentation or code that uses the font, and ensuring that any modifications made to the font are done in accordance with the license.
