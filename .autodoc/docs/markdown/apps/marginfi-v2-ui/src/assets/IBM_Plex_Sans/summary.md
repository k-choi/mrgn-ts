To use the IBM Plex Sans font in the mrgn-ts project, developers can include the font files in the project's assets folder and reference them in the project's CSS files. For example, to use the regular version of the font in a heading, the following CSS code could be used:

}
```

This code sets the font family to 'IBM Plex Sans' and the font weight to 400, which corresponds to the regular version of the font. Similar code could be used to reference the other versions of the font.
