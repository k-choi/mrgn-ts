The `token_info.json` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/apps/marginfi-v2-ui/src/assets` folder contains a JSON object that provides information about various tokens used in the mrgn-ts project. Each token is represented as a separate object within the array, and each object contains properties such as the token's address, chain ID, decimals, name, symbol, logo URI, and extensions.

This code serves as a centralized location for information about the various tokens used in the mrgn-ts project. By storing this information in a single file, it can be easily accessed and used by other parts of the project. For example, this information could be used to display token balances or to provide users with information about the tokens they are trading.

To use this code in the larger project, developers can import the `tokens` array from the `mrgn-ts` project and use it to access information about specific tokens. For example, to find the token object for USDC, the following code could be used:

```typescript
import tokens from "mrgn-ts/tokens";

const usdc = tokens.find((token) => token.symbol === "USDC");
console.log(`The address of USDC is ${usdc.address}`);
```

In this example, the `find` method is used to locate the token object for USDC, and the address of the USDC token is logged to the console.

Overall, the `token_info.json` file is an important part of the mrgn-ts project as it provides information about the various tokens used in the project. This information can be easily accessed and used by other parts of the project, making it a valuable resource for developers working on the project.
