The code in this file provides utility functions for working with bank and account data in the mrgn-ts project. It imports several types and functions from other modules, including `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2`, `~/types`, `~/config`, `~/utils`, and `@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common`.

The `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_SUMMARY` constant defines an object with default values for an account summary. The `computeAccountSummary` function takes a `MarginfiAccount` object and returns an `AccountSummary` object with information about the account's balance, lending and borrowing amounts, and APY. The `makeBankInfo` function takes a `Bank` object and a `TokenMetadata` object and returns a `BankInfo` object with information about the bank's address, token icon, name, price, mint, decimals, interest rates, total pool deposits and borrows, liquidity, utilization rate, and the bank itself. The `makeExtendedBankInfo` function takes a `BankInfo` object, a `TokenAccount` object, a native SOL balance, and a `MarginfiAccount` object (which may be null) and returns an `ExtendedBankInfo` object with additional information about the bank, including whether the user has an active position, the user's token balance, and the maximum deposit, withdraw, borrow, and repay amounts. Finally, the `makeUserPosition` function takes a `Balance` object and a `BankInfo` object and returns a `UserPosition` object with information about the user's position in the bank.

These functions can be used to retrieve and manipulate data about banks and accounts in the mrgn-ts project. For example, `computeAccountSummary` could be used to display a user's account summary on a dashboard, while `makeBankInfo` and `makeExtendedBankInfo` could be used to display information about available banks and their details. `makeUserPosition` could be used to display a user's position in a particular bank. Overall, these functions provide a convenient way to work with bank and account data in the mrgn-ts project.

## Questions:

1.  What external libraries or dependencies are being used in this code?

- The code is importing various modules from "@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2", "~/types", "~/config", "~/utils", and "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common".

2. What is the purpose of the `makeExtendedBankInfo` function?

- The `makeExtendedBankInfo` function takes in various parameters related to a bank and a user's account, and returns an object with extended information about the bank, including the user's position and maximum deposit/withdraw/borrow/repay amounts.

3. What is the `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_SUMMARY` object used for?

- The `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_SUMMARY` object is a default value for an `AccountSummary` object, which is returned by the `computeAccountSummary` function. If the `computeAccountSummary` function encounters an error or does not return a valid `AccountSummary` object, it will return the `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_SUMMARY` object instead.
