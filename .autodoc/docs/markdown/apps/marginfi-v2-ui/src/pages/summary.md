Name: components

Summary: The `components` folder in the `marginfi-v2-ui` app contains various React components that are used to build the user interface of the application. Each component is a self-contained piece of code that can be reused throughout the application.

Some of the components in this folder include:

- `AccountSummary`: A component that displays the user's Solana account balance and token holdings.
- `AssetsList`: A component that displays a list of the user's assets.
- `CampaignWizard`: A component that allows the user to create a new campaign.
- `MultipleAccountsFoundWarning`: A component that displays a warning message if the user has more than one account.
- `Navbar`: A component that displays a navigation bar at the top of the application.
- `PageHeader`: A component that displays a header at the top of a page.
- `UserPositions`: A component that displays the user's positions in various markets.

These components can be used in various parts of the application to build the user interface. For example, the `AccountSummary` component can be used on the home page to display the user's account balance, while the `CampaignWizard` component can be used on a separate page to allow the user to create a new campaign.

Here is an example of how the `AccountSummary` component might be used in another component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import AccountSummary from "~/components/AccountSummary";

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the mrgn-ts project!</h1>
      <AccountSummary />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

In this example, the `HomePage` component renders a welcome message and the `AccountSummary` component. When the user navigates to the home page, they will see the welcome message and the `AccountSummary` component, which will display the user's account balance and token holdings.

Overall, the `components` folder contains reusable React components that can be used throughout the `marginfi-v2-ui` app to build the user interface. These components can be imported and used in other parts of the application to display information, allow user interaction, and provide a consistent look and feel.
