This file contains various interfaces, types, and enums that are used in the mrgn-ts project. The purpose of this code is to define the data structures that are used to represent different aspects of the project, such as bank information, user positions, and token metadata.

The `BankInfo` interface defines the properties of a bank, including its address, token name, mint, price, and rates. It also includes information about the bank's total pool deposits, total pool borrows, available liquidity, and utilization rate. Additionally, it includes a reference to the `Bank` class from the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` library.

The `UserPosition` interface defines the properties of a user's position in a bank, including whether they are lending or borrowing, the amount they have deposited or borrowed, and the value of their position in USD.

The `TokenMetadata` interface defines the properties of a token, including its icon.

The `TokenAccount` interface defines the properties of a token account, including the mint, whether it has been created, and the balance.

The `ActionType` enum defines the different types of actions that can be taken in a bank, including deposit, borrow, repay, and withdraw.

The `BankInfoForAccountBase` interface extends the `BankInfo` interface and adds properties that are specific to a user's account, including their token balance, maximum deposit, maximum repay, maximum withdraw, and maximum borrow.

The `ActiveBankInfo` and `InactiveBankInfo` types extend the `BankInfoForAccountBase` interface and add a `hasActivePosition` property that indicates whether the user has an active position in the bank. If they do, the `ActiveBankInfo` type also includes a `position` property that contains information about their position.

The `ExtendedBankInfo` type is a union of `ActiveBankInfo` and `InactiveBankInfo` and is used to represent a bank's information in different contexts.

The `isActiveBankInfo` function is a type guard that checks whether a given `ExtendedBankInfo` object is of type `ActiveBankInfo`.

Overall, this code provides a set of data structures that can be used to represent different aspects of the mrgn-ts project, such as banks, user positions, and tokens. These structures can be used throughout the project to store and manipulate data. For example, the `BankInfo` interface can be used to represent a bank's information, while the `UserPosition` interface can be used to represent a user's position in a bank. The `ActionType` enum can be used to specify the type of action a user wants to take in a bank, and the `isActiveBankInfo` function can be used to check whether a bank has an active user position.

## Questions:

1.  What is the purpose of the `Bank` import from `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2`?

- A smart developer might ask what the `Bank` class from `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` is used for within this code.
- Answer: The `Bank` class is used as a property of the `BankInfo` interface to provide additional information about a bank.

2. What is the difference between `ActiveBankInfo` and `InactiveBankInfo`?

   - A smart developer might ask what distinguishes `ActiveBankInfo` from `InactiveBankInfo`.
   - Answer: `ActiveBankInfo` includes a `UserPosition` property, indicating that the user has an active position with the bank, while `InactiveBankInfo` does not.

3. What is the purpose of the `isActiveBankInfo` function?
   - A smart developer might ask why the `isActiveBankInfo` function is defined and what it is used for.
   - Answer: The `isActiveBankInfo` function is a type guard that checks whether a given `ExtendedBankInfo` object is of type `ActiveBankInfo`. It is used to differentiate between `ActiveBankInfo` and `InactiveBankInfo` objects.
