The `globals.css` file in the `styles` folder of the `marginfi-v2-ui` app in the `mrgn-ts` project is responsible for defining the global styles for the website. It sets up the basic layout and appearance of the website, including fonts, colors, and backgrounds.

The file starts by importing the Tailwind CSS framework and defining some custom utility classes using the `@layer` directive. These classes hide scrollbars on certain elements using vendor-specific CSS properties.

The `:root` selector defines some custom CSS variables that are used throughout the file. These variables define colors, gradients, and other values that are used to style various elements on the page.

The `*` selector applies some basic styles to all elements on the page, including setting the box-sizing property to border-box and removing margins and padding.

The `html` and `body` selectors set the maximum width and height of the page to 100vw and 100vh, respectively, and hide horizontal overflow. The `body` selector also sets the background color and image of the page, as well as the font family and weight.

The file then defines several `@font-face` rules that import custom fonts for the project. These fonts are used throughout the site to provide a consistent look and feel.

Overall, this file sets up the basic styles and fonts for the `marginfi-v2-ui` app in the `mrgn-ts` project. It provides a starting point for more specific styles to be added in other CSS files.

To use the styles defined in this file, it would need to be imported into the project's main CSS file using an `@import` rule. For example:

```css
@import url("globals.css");
```

This would make the styles defined in `globals.css` available to all elements on the page. Specific styles could then be added or overridden in other CSS files as needed.

This file is an important part of the `marginfi-v2-ui` app in the `mrgn-ts` project as it defines the basic styles and fonts for the website. It works with other parts of the project by providing a consistent look and feel across all pages. For example, if a new page is added to the website, it would automatically inherit the styles defined in `globals.css`.

Developers working on this project can use this file as a starting point for creating new styles or modifying existing ones. They can also use the custom utility classes defined in this file to quickly add styles to specific elements on the page. For example, if they want to hide the scrollbar on a specific element, they can simply add the `scrollbar-none` class to that element.

In summary, the `globals.css` file in the `styles` folder of the `marginfi-v2-ui` app in the `mrgn-ts` project defines the basic styles and fonts for the website. It works with other parts of the project by providing a consistent look and feel across all pages. Developers can use this file as a starting point for creating new styles or modifying existing ones.
