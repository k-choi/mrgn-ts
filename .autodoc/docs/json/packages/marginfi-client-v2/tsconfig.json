  "summary": "This code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler, which is used in the mrgn-ts project. The file is written in JSON format and contains several properties that specify how the compiler should behave.\n\nThe \"extends\" property specifies that this configuration file should inherit from another file located at \"@mrgnlabs/tsconfig/base.json\". This means that any properties defined in the base file will be included in this file as well.\n\nThe \"compilerOptions\" property is where most of the configuration options are set. The \"resolveJsonModule\" option tells the compiler to allow importing JSON files as modules. The \"outDir\" option specifies the output directory for compiled files.\n\nThe \"include\" property specifies which files should be included in the compilation process. In this case, it includes all files in the current directory.\n\nThe \"exclude\" property specifies which files should be excluded from the compilation process. In this case, it excludes the \"dist\" directory, the \"node_modules\" directory, and the \"examples\" directory.\n\nOverall, this configuration file is used to set up the TypeScript compiler for the mrgn-ts project. It specifies how the compiler should behave and which files should be included or excluded from the compilation process. Developers working on the project can modify this file to customize the compiler options to their needs. \n\nExample usage:\n\nTo compile TypeScript files using this configuration file, run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\ntsc\n```\n\nThis will compile all TypeScript files in the current directory and output the compiled JavaScript files to the \"dist\" directory, as specified in the \"outDir\" option.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the base.json file that this code is extending from?** \nA smart developer might want to know what configurations are included in the base.json file that this code is extending from, as it could impact the behavior of this code.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the \"resolveJsonModule\" option?** \nA smart developer might want to know what the \"resolveJsonModule\" option does and how it affects the code's behavior.\n\n3. **Why are the \"dist\", \"node_modules\", and \"examples\" directories excluded?** \nA smart developer might want to know why these specific directories are being excluded and if there are any potential implications for the code's functionality."
