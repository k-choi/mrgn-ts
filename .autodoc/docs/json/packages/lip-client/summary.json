      "summary": "This code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler in the mrgn-ts project. The file is named `tsconfig.json` and is located in the root directory of the project. \n\nThe `extends` property specifies that this configuration file extends another configuration file located at `@mrgnlabs/tsconfig/base.json`. This means that the settings in `base.json` will be inherited by this file, and any changes made in this file will override the settings in `base.json`.\n\nThe `compilerOptions` property is an object that specifies options for the TypeScript compiler. In this case, the `resolveJsonModule` option is set to `true`, which allows TypeScript to import JSON files as modules. The `outDir` option specifies the output directory for compiled TypeScript files.\n\nThe `include` property is an array of file or directory paths that should be included in the compilation process. In this case, the `.` path includes all files in the current directory.\n\nThe `exclude` property is an array of file or directory paths that should be excluded from the compilation process. In this case, the `dist` and `node_modules` directories are excluded.\n\nOverall, this configuration file sets up the TypeScript compiler to compile all TypeScript files in the current directory, with output files going to the `dist` directory. It also allows for importing JSON files as modules. This file is an important part of the mrgn-ts project, as it ensures that TypeScript files are compiled correctly and that the project is set up to use JSON files as modules. \n\nExample usage:\n```\n// Import a JSON file as a module\nimport data from './data.json';\n\n// Use the imported data\nconsole.log(data);\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the base.json file that this code is extending from?\n- The code is extending from a file called base.json located in the @mrgnlabs/tsconfig directory.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the \"resolveJsonModule\" option in the compilerOptions?\n- The \"resolveJsonModule\" option allows the TypeScript compiler to import JSON files as modules.\n\n3. Why are the \"dist\" and \"node_modules\" directories excluded from the compilation process?\n- The \"dist\" directory is excluded because that is where the compiled code will be outputted to. The \"node_modules\" directory is excluded because it contains external dependencies that do not need to be compiled."

  "summary": "The `lip-client` folder in the `mrgn-ts` project contains code related to the client-side of the project. One of the subfolders in this folder is the `components` folder, which contains reusable React components that can be used throughout the project.\n\nThe `components` folder contains several subfolders, each with its own set of React components. For example, the `common` folder contains components that are used across the project, such as buttons and input fields. The `dashboard` folder contains components that are specific to the project's dashboard, such as charts and graphs.\n\nEach component is defined in its own TypeScript file, with the file name matching the name of the component. The code in each file exports a React component that can be imported and used in other parts of the project.\n\nFor example, to use the `Button` component from the `common` folder, you would import it like this:\n\n```\nimport { Button } from '../components/common/Button';\n```\n\nYou can then use the `Button` component in your code like any other React component:\n\n```\n<Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>Click me</Button>\n```\n\nThe `components` folder is an important part of the `mrgn-ts` project, as it provides a library of reusable React components that can be used throughout the project. By organizing the components into subfolders based on their purpose, it makes it easier for developers to find the components they need and reduces the amount of code duplication in the project.\n\nOverall, the `components` folder is a crucial part of the `mrgn-ts` project's client-side codebase, providing a library of reusable React components that can be used throughout the project.",
