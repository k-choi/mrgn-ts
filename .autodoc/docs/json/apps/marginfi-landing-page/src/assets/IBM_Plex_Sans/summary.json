      "summary": "This code is a license for the use of a font called \"Plex\" that is owned by IBM Corp. The license is the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, which allows the font to be used, studied, modified, and redistributed freely as long as it is not sold by itself. The font can be bundled, embedded, redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The license also states that the font and its derivatives cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for the font to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the font or its derivatives.\n\nThis license is important for the mrgn-ts project because it allows the project to use the \"Plex\" font without any legal issues. The license ensures that the font can be modified and redistributed freely, which is important for a project that may need to customize the font for its specific needs. The license also allows the font to be bundled with any software, which is important for a project that may need to distribute the font with its software.\n\nExample of how this license may be used in the mrgn-ts project:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IBM+Plex+Sans\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1 style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Welcome to mrgn-ts!</h1>\n  <p style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod, nisl vel bibendum bibendum, velit sapien bibendum sapien, vel bibendum sapien sapien vel sapien.</p>\n</body>\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"Plex\" font is being used in the mrgn-ts project through the Google Fonts API. The font is specified in the CSS using the font-family property, which is set to \"IBM Plex Sans\". This is possible because the font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, which allows the font to be used and distributed freely.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code is the license for the mrgn-ts font software, which is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.\n\n2. Can the licensed fonts be sold?\n   \n   No, the licensed fonts, including any derivative works, cannot be sold by themselves. However, they can be bundled, embedded, redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works.\n\n3. What are the conditions for using and distributing the licensed fonts?\n   \n   The licensed fonts can be used, studied, copied, merged, embedded, modified, redistributed, and sold, subject to certain conditions, including that the fonts must be distributed entirely under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, and that any reserved font names cannot be used without explicit written permission from the corresponding copyright holder."
