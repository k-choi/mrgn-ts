      "summary": "This code is a license for a font called \"Plex\" that is being used in the mrgn-ts project. The license is the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. The license allows the font to be used, studied, modified, and redistributed freely as long as it is not sold by itself. The font can be bundled, embedded, redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The font and its derivatives cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for the font to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the font or its derivatives.\n\nThis license is important for the mrgn-ts project because it ensures that the font being used is legally allowed to be used, modified, and distributed freely. It also ensures that any derivative works of the font cannot be released under any other type of license. This helps to protect the project from any legal issues that may arise from the use of the font.\n\nExample of how this license may be used in the mrgn-ts project:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Plex&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n```\n\nIn this example, the font \"Plex\" is being used in the mrgn-ts project through the Google Fonts API. The SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 ensures that the font can be used in this way without any legal issues.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code is the license for the mrgn-ts font software, which is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.\n\n2. Can the licensed fonts be sold?\n   \n   No, the licensed fonts, including any derivative works, cannot be sold by themselves. However, they can be bundled, embedded, redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works.\n\n3. What are the conditions for using, modifying, and distributing the licensed fonts?\n   \n   The licensed fonts can be used, studied, modified, and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. Any modified versions of the font software must be distributed entirely under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, and must not be released under any other type of license. Additionally, any reserved font names cannot be used unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding copyright holder."

  "summary": "The folder `.autodoc/docs/json/apps/marginfi-landing-page/src/assets/IBM_Plex_Mono` contains the OFL.txt file, which is a license for the font called \"Plex\" that is being used in the mrgn-ts project. This license ensures that the font can be used, modified, and distributed freely without any legal issues.\n\nThe IBM_Plex_Mono font is a monospaced font that is part of the IBM Plex font family. It is designed to be used in programming environments and is optimized for legibility and ease of use. The font is available in several weights and styles, including regular, bold, italic, and bold italic.\n\nIn the context of the mrgn-ts project, the IBM_Plex_Mono font may be used in various parts of the project where a monospaced font is required. For example, it may be used in the code editor or terminal interface of the project. The font may also be used in the project's documentation or website to provide a consistent and professional look and feel.\n\nHere is an example of how the IBM_Plex_Mono font may be used in the mrgn-ts project:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the IBM_Plex_Mono font is set as the font family for the body element of the project's website. The monospace fallback ensures that the font is displayed correctly on all devices and browsers. The font size and line height are also set to provide a comfortable reading experience.\n\nOverall, the IBM_Plex_Mono font is an important part of the mrgn-ts project's design and functionality. Its legibility and ease of use make it an ideal choice for programming environments, and its availability under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 ensures that it can be used freely without any legal issues.",
