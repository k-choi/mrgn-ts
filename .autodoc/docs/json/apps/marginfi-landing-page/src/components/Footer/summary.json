      "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `Footer` that renders a fixed navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. The navigation bar consists of three sections: the left section contains links to the MarginFi documentation, analytics, and GitHub pages; the middle section contains a single link to the MarginFi decentralized lending and borrowing protocol; and the right section contains links to the MarginFi Twitter and Telegram pages, as well as a disabled link to the MRGN, Inc. website.\n\nThe navigation bar is implemented using the `Link` component from the Next.js framework, which allows for client-side navigation without a full page refresh. Each link is wrapped in a `NavbarCenterItem` component, which is not defined in this file but is presumably imported from another module. The `NavbarCenterItem` component renders a styled button with the text of the link.\n\nThe middle section of the navigation bar is hidden on small screens and only appears on screens larger than the \"lg\" breakpoint. It consists of a single link to the MarginFi protocol wrapped in a `NavbarCenterItem` component.\n\nThe `Footer` component is exported from the module and can be imported and used in other parts of the project. It is likely intended to be included in the layout of multiple pages to provide consistent navigation across the site.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Footer } from \"mrgn-ts/Footer\";\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* page content */}\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the project?\n- This code defines a React functional component called `Footer` that renders a fixed navigation bar at the bottom of the page. It is likely used as a common footer component across multiple pages of the `mrgn-ts` project.\n\n2. What external libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?\n- This code imports several external libraries and frameworks, including `react`, `next/link`, `next/image`, and `@mui/material`. It also imports a custom CSS module called `Footer.module.css`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `NavbarCenterItem` and `Button` components, and where are they defined?\n- The `NavbarCenterItem` component is a custom component that is likely defined elsewhere in the project. It is used to render a clickable link with a text label in the center of the navigation bar. The `Button` component is imported from the `@mui/material` library but is not actually used in this code."

      "summary": "This code defines the styling for two buttons: `.wallet-button` and `.airdrop-button`. These buttons are likely used in the user interface of the mrgn-ts project. \n\nThe `.wallet-button` class sets the height, width, font size, color, background color, border, padding, border radius, display, justify content, align items, font weight, and text transform properties for the button. The button has a gray background color and black text color, with a rounded border. The text is centered within the button. \n\nThe `.airdrop-button` class sets the background color, text color, border, padding, height, and border radius properties for the button. The button has a greenish background color with low opacity, and white text color. The button has a rounded border and is slightly taller than the `.wallet-button`. \n\nThe `.airdrop-button:hover` class sets the font weight, background color, text color, border, and border radius properties for the button when the user hovers over it. The button becomes bold, the background color becomes transparent, the text color becomes white, and the border becomes white. The border radius remains the same. \n\nOverall, this code defines the visual appearance of two buttons that are likely used in the user interface of the mrgn-ts project. The `.wallet-button` is a gray button with black text, while the `.airdrop-button` is a greenish button with white text. When the user hovers over the `.airdrop-button`, it becomes bold and the colors invert.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `.wallet-button` and `.airdrop-button` classes?\n   - The `.wallet-button` class is used to style a button related to a wallet feature, while the `.airdrop-button` class is used to style a button related to an airdrop feature.\n   \n2. What is the significance of the `!important` keyword used in the CSS properties?\n   - The `!important` keyword is used to give priority to the CSS property over other properties that may be inherited or specified elsewhere in the code.\n   \n3. What is the effect of hovering over an element with the `.airdrop-button:hover` class?\n   - When hovering over an element with the `.airdrop-button:hover` class, the font weight becomes bold, the background color becomes transparent, the text color becomes white, and the border becomes white and slightly rounded."

      "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `NavbarCenterItem` that renders a `Button` component from the Material-UI library. The component takes in four props: `text`, `textFormat`, `disabled`, and `onClick`. \n\nThe `text` prop is a required string that specifies the text to be displayed on the button. The `textFormat` prop is an optional string that specifies the text formatting to be applied to the button text. If not provided, the default value is `\"normal-case\"`. The `disabled` prop is an optional boolean that specifies whether the button should be disabled or not. If not provided, the default value is `false`. The `onClick` prop is an optional function that specifies the action to be taken when the button is clicked.\n\nThe `Button` component is styled using CSS classes and inline styles. The `className` prop specifies a set of CSS classes to be applied to the button. These classes define the button's height, width, font size, alignment, and font weight. The `variant` prop specifies the button's appearance. In this case, it is set to `\"text\"`, which means the button has no background color and a transparent border. The `disabled` prop specifies whether the button is disabled or not. If it is disabled, the button's text color is set to a light gray color. The `style` prop specifies a set of inline styles to be applied to the button. These styles define the button's text color, background color, and font family. The `onClick` prop specifies the function to be called when the button is clicked.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project as a reusable button component that can be customized with different text, formatting, and click actions. For example, it can be used in a navigation bar as a center item that links to a specific page or performs a specific action when clicked. Here is an example usage of the `NavbarCenterItem` component:\n\n```\nimport { NavbarCenterItem } from \"mrgn-ts\";\n\nconst MyNavbar = () => (\n  <nav>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">About</a></li>\n      <li><NavbarCenterItem text=\"Contact Us\" onClick={() => console.log(\"Contact Us clicked\")} /></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">FAQ</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">Blog</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </nav>\n);\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a React functional component called `NavbarCenterItem` that renders a Material UI `Button` with customizable text, text formatting, and click behavior.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code rely on?\n   This code imports two modules: `Button` from the `@mui/material` package and `FC` from the `react` package.\n\n3. What are the customizable props for the `NavbarCenterItem` component?\n   The `NavbarCenterItem` component accepts four props: `text` (string), `textFormat` (string, optional), `disabled` (boolean, optional), and `onClick` (function, optional). These props control the text content, text formatting, disabled state, and click behavior of the rendered button."
