  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `PageHeader` that returns a header section for a web page. The component is exported for use in other parts of the project. \n\nThe header section is contained within a `div` element with a class name of \"hidden sm:flex w-full flex-row justify-center border-solid border-[#1C2125] border-y-[1px]\". This class name applies CSS styles to the `div` element, including making it a flex container that is horizontally centered and has a solid border at the top and bottom of 1 pixel width. The \"hidden sm:flex\" part of the class name means that the element is hidden on small screens but displayed as a flex container on larger screens.\n\nInside the `div` element, there is another `div` element that contains the actual header content. This `div` element has a class name that applies CSS styles to it, including setting its height to 80 pixels, its width to 90% of its parent element's width, and its maximum width to 7xl (a custom size). It also sets the left padding to 60 pixels, aligns its child elements vertically centered, and applies a custom font and font size. The background of the `div` element is set to an image file called \"WaveBG3.png\" using a URL.\n\nThe text \"mrgnlend\" is displayed inside the inner `div` element as the header content.\n\nThis component can be used in other parts of the project by importing it and rendering it as a JSX element. For example:\n\n```\nimport { PageHeader } from \"mrgn-ts\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PageHeader />\n      <p>Welcome to my website!</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis would render the `PageHeader` component followed by a paragraph element containing the text \"Welcome to my website!\".",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this component?\n- This component is a page header that displays the text \"mrgnlend\" on a background image.\n\n2. What dependencies does this component have?\n- This component imports the FC (FunctionComponent) type from the React library.\n\n3. What styling is applied to this component?\n- This component has a border, a background image, and specific font styles applied to it using CSS classes."
