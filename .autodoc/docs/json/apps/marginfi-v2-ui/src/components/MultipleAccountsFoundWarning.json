  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `MultipleAccountsFoundWarning`. This component is used to display a warning message when multiple user accounts are found, which is not supported by the application. The warning message is displayed in a div element with a specific class name that defines its styling. The class name includes properties such as background color, border radius, padding, and font size. The message itself is a string that informs the user that multiple accounts were found and advises them to contact the team or use the application at their own risk.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to provide a warning message to users when multiple accounts are detected. This can help prevent errors or confusion that may arise from having multiple accounts associated with a single user. The component can be imported into other React components and used as a child element to display the warning message.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { MultipleAccountsFoundWarning } from \"mrgn-ts\";\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const accounts = [\"account1\", \"account2\", \"account3\"];\n\n  if (accounts.length > 1) {\n    return <MultipleAccountsFoundWarning />;\n  }\n\n  return <div>My component content</div>;\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` checks if there are multiple accounts associated with the user. If there are, it returns the `MultipleAccountsFoundWarning` component to display the warning message. If not, it displays the content of the component as usual. This helps ensure that users are aware of the potential risks of using multiple accounts and can take appropriate action to avoid any issues.",
