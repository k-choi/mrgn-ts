  "summary": "The `AccountSummary` component is a React functional component that displays a summary of the user's account information. It imports several modules from the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` and `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` libraries, as well as several custom components from the same project.\n\nThe component first retrieves the user's account summary and selected account from the `useUserAccounts` hook, and the wallet object from the `useWallet` hook. It then calculates the health factor of the selected account, which is a measure of the account's solvency. The health factor is calculated by dividing the difference between the assets and liabilities of the account by the assets, and then converting the result to a number. If the selected account is null, the health factor is set to 1.\n\nThe component then renders the account summary information in a responsive layout. On mobile devices, the account balance and health factor are displayed side-by-side, while on desktop devices only the account balance is displayed. The component also displays three account metrics: lending amount, borrowing amount, and net APY. The lending and borrowing amounts are displayed as formatted USD amounts, while the net APY is displayed as a percentage with a color-coded preview of whether it is positive or negative. Finally, the component displays the health factor as a circular gauge.\n\nThis component is likely used as part of a larger project that provides a user interface for a financial application. It provides a quick overview of the user's account information, including their balance, lending and borrowing amounts, and solvency. The component is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, and provides a clear and concise summary of the user's financial position.",
