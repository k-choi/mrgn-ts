  "summary": "The code defines a custom toggle switch component called `BorrowLendToggle` that is used to switch between two modes: borrowing and lending. The component is built using the `styled` function from the Material UI library and extends the `Switch` component from the same library. \n\nThe `BorrowLendToggle` component takes in two props: `isInLendingMode` and `setIsInLendingMode`. The former is a boolean value that indicates whether the toggle is currently in lending mode or not, while the latter is a function that updates the `isInLendingMode` prop when the toggle is clicked. \n\nThe component renders a `Switch` component with some custom styles applied to it. The `checked` prop of the `Switch` component is set to the opposite of the `isInLendingMode` prop, which means that the toggle will be in the opposite mode of the current `isInLendingMode` value. When the toggle is clicked, the `setIsInLendingMode` function is called with the opposite value of the current `isInLendingMode` value, effectively toggling the mode.\n\nThe custom styles applied to the `Switch` component include setting the width and height of the component, setting the background color and border, and adding text labels for the two modes. The `& .MuiSwitch-switchBase` selector is used to style the thumb of the toggle, while the `& .MuiSwitch-thumb` selector is used to style the track of the toggle.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that requires a toggle switch to switch between two modes, such as a borrowing and lending mode in a financial application. An example usage of the component would be as follows:\n\n```\nimport { BorrowLendToggle } from 'mrgn-ts';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isInLendingMode, setIsInLendingMode] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <BorrowLendToggle isInLendingMode={isInLendingMode} setIsInLendingMode={setIsInLendingMode} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BorrowLendToggle` component?\n   - The `BorrowLendToggle` component is a styled switch component that toggles between \"Borrow\" and \"Lend\" modes and updates the `isInLendingMode` state based on the user's selection.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `BorrowLendToggleProps` interface?\n   - The `BorrowLendToggleProps` interface extends the `SwitchProps` interface from the `@mui/material` library and adds two additional properties: `isInLendingMode` and `setIsInLendingMode`, which are used to manage the state of the toggle.\n\n3. Why is there a `focusVisibleClassName` property in the `Switch` component?\n   - The `focusVisibleClassName` property is used to apply a class name to the switch component when it is focused, which can be used to apply custom styles to the focused state of the component."
