      "summary": "The `AssetsList` component is a React functional component that renders a list of assets. It imports several hooks and components from external libraries and other files in the project. \n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of whether the user is in lending mode or not. It also uses the `useProgram`, `useBanks`, `useUserAccounts`, and `useWallet` hooks to retrieve data from the Solana blockchain and the user's wallet. \n\nThe component renders a `BorrowLendToggle` component that allows the user to switch between borrowing and lending modes. It also renders a `Card` component that contains a `TableContainer` component, which in turn contains a `Table` component. The `Table` component renders a list of `AssetRow` components, one for each asset in the user's account. \n\nThe `AssetRow` component displays information about the asset, such as its name, symbol, balance, and value. It also displays buttons that allow the user to deposit, withdraw, borrow, or repay the asset. The component uses the `marginfiClient` object to interact with the Solana program that manages the assets. \n\nIf the `extendedBankInfos` array is empty, the component renders a `LoadingAssets` component that displays a skeleton loading animation. The `LoadingAssets` component renders a table row with a `Skeleton` component for each asset. \n\nOverall, the `AssetsList` component provides a user interface for managing assets on the Solana blockchain. It allows the user to view their assets, switch between borrowing and lending modes, and perform various actions on their assets. The component is part of a larger project called `mrgn-ts` and is likely used in conjunction with other components and modules to provide a complete user experience.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AssetsList` component?\n- The `AssetsList` component is responsible for rendering a list of asset rows, which are either in lending or borrowing mode based on the state of the `isInLendingMode` variable.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `LoadingAssets` component?\n- The `LoadingAssets` component is responsible for rendering a skeleton loading state for the asset rows while the data is being fetched.\n\n3. What external libraries or dependencies are being used in this file?\n- This file is using several external libraries and dependencies, including React, @solana/wallet-adapter-react, @mui/material, and custom hooks from the `~/context` module."

      "summary": "The code defines a custom toggle switch component called `BorrowLendToggle` that is used to switch between two modes: borrowing and lending. The component is built using the `styled` function from the Material UI library and extends the `Switch` component from the same library. \n\nThe `BorrowLendToggle` component takes in two props: `isInLendingMode` and `setIsInLendingMode`. The former is a boolean value that indicates whether the toggle is currently in lending mode or not, while the latter is a function that updates the `isInLendingMode` prop when the toggle is clicked. \n\nThe component renders a `Switch` component with some custom styles applied to it. The `checked` prop of the `Switch` component is set to the opposite of the `isInLendingMode` prop, which means that the toggle will be in the opposite mode of the current `isInLendingMode` value. When the toggle is clicked, the `setIsInLendingMode` function is called with the opposite value of the current `isInLendingMode` value, effectively toggling the mode.\n\nThe custom styles applied to the `Switch` component include setting the width and height of the component, setting the background color and border, and adding text labels for the two modes. The `& .MuiSwitch-switchBase` selector is used to style the thumb of the toggle, while the `& .MuiSwitch-thumb` selector is used to style the track of the toggle.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that requires a toggle switch to switch between two modes, such as a borrowing and lending mode in a financial application. An example usage of the component would be as follows:\n\n```\nimport { BorrowLendToggle } from 'mrgn-ts';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isInLendingMode, setIsInLendingMode] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <BorrowLendToggle isInLendingMode={isInLendingMode} setIsInLendingMode={setIsInLendingMode} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BorrowLendToggle` component?\n   - The `BorrowLendToggle` component is a styled switch component that toggles between \"Borrow\" and \"Lend\" modes and updates the `isInLendingMode` state based on the user's selection.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `BorrowLendToggleProps` interface?\n   - The `BorrowLendToggleProps` interface extends the `SwitchProps` interface from the `@mui/material` library and adds two additional properties: `isInLendingMode` and `setIsInLendingMode`, which are used to manage the state of the toggle.\n\n3. Why is there a `focusVisibleClassName` property in the `Switch` component?\n   - The `focusVisibleClassName` property is used to apply a class name to the switch component when it is focused, which can be used to apply custom styles to the focused state of the component."

When the user clicks the action button, the component performs various checks to ensure that the user has entered a valid amount and that the user has the necessary funds to perform the action. If the checks pass, the component creates a Marginfi account for the user (if one does not already exist) and performs the relevant Solana transaction (e.g., deposit, withdraw, borrow, or repay). The component then updates the user's bank information and displays a toast message to the user indicating whether the transaction was successful or not.",

These props include the `children` prop, which is used to render the text inside the button, and the `disabled` prop, which is used to disable the button if it cannot be clicked. The component also accepts any other props that can be passed to a Material-UI `Button`.\n\nThe `useWallet` hook from the Solana Wallet Adapter React library is used to get the current state of the wallet. If the wallet is connected, the component renders a `Button` with the specified styles and props. If the wallet is not connected, the component renders a dynamic `WalletMultiButton` component from the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` library.

  "summary": "The `AssetsList` folder in the `mrgn-ts` project contains several files and subfolders that provide components and functionality for managing financial assets on the Solana blockchain. The main file in this folder is `AssetsList.tsx`, which defines a React functional component that renders a list of assets and allows the user to switch between borrowing and lending modes.\n\nThe `AssetsList` component imports several hooks and components from external libraries and other files in the project to retrieve data from the Solana blockchain and the user's wallet. It renders a `BorrowLendToggle` component that allows the user to switch between borrowing and lending modes, and a `Table` component that renders a list of `AssetRow` components, one for each asset in the user's account.\n\nThe `AssetRow` subfolder contains several components that can be used to render and interact with individual assets in the `AssetsList` component. These components include `AssetRowHeader`, `AssetRowMetric`, `AssetRowInputBox`, and `AssetRowAction`. The `AssetRowAction` component is a reusable component that can be used throughout the project to render buttons that interact with a Solana wallet.\n\nThe `index.ts` file in the `AssetsList` folder exports the `AssetsList` class, which can be used in other parts of the project to create and manage lists of assets. For example, it could be used to create a list of assets needed for a game or to display a list of financial assets in a trading application.\n\nHere is an example of how the `BorrowLendToggle` component could be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport { BorrowLendToggle } from 'mrgn-ts';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isInLendingMode, setIsInLendingMode] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <BorrowLendToggle isInLendingMode={isInLendingMode} setIsInLendingMode={setIsInLendingMode} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `BorrowLendToggle` component is imported from the `mrgn-ts` project and used in a React functional component called `MyComponent`. The `isInLendingMode` state variable and `setIsInLendingMode` function are passed as props to the `BorrowLendToggle` component, which allows the user to switch between borrowing and lending modes.\n\nOverall, the `AssetsList` folder provides a set of components and functionality for managing financial assets on the Solana blockchain. These components can be used in various parts of the larger `mrgn-ts` project to create a complete user experience for managing assets.",
