  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `AssetRowHeader` that renders a table cell containing information about a financial asset. The component takes in four props: `assetName` (a string representing the name of the asset), `apy` (a number representing the asset's annual percentage yield), `icon` (an optional string representing the URL of an icon for the asset), and `isInLendingMode` (a boolean indicating whether the asset is currently in lending mode).\n\nThe component first renders a div containing the asset's icon (if provided) and name. It then conditionally renders a div containing the text \"Current APY\" (only visible on larger screens) and another div containing the asset's APY percentage, formatted using a utility function called `percentFormatter`. The background color and text color of this div depend on whether the asset is in lending mode or not.\n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that displays information about various financial assets, such as a portfolio management dashboard or investment tracking app. It could be used in conjunction with other components to create a table or list of assets, with each row containing an `AssetRowHeader` cell and additional cells for other information such as current price, market cap, or trading volume. The `AssetRowHeader` component could also be customized or extended to include additional information or functionality, such as a tooltip with more detailed information about the asset or a button to toggle lending mode on or off.",
