      "summary": "The `AssetRow` component is a React functional component that renders a table row for a single asset in the Marginfi application. The component takes in several props, including `bankInfo`, which is an object containing information about the asset, such as its name, icon, price, and balance; `isInLendingMode`, which is a boolean indicating whether the user is currently in lending mode or borrowing mode; `isConnected`, which is a boolean indicating whether the user is currently connected to a wallet; `marginfiAccount`, which is an object representing the user's Marginfi account; `marginfiClient`, which is an object representing the Marginfi client; and `reloadBanks`, which is a function that reloads the user's bank information.\n\nThe component is composed of several sub-components, including `AssetRowHeader`, `AssetRowMetric`, `AssetRowInputBox`, and `AssetRowAction`, which are responsible for rendering the header, metrics, input box, and action button for the asset row, respectively.\n\nThe `AssetRow` component also contains several state variables, including `borrowOrLendAmount`, which represents the amount of the asset that the user wants to borrow or lend; and `currentAction`, which represents the current action that the user can take with the asset (e.g., deposit, withdraw, borrow, or repay).\n\nThe `AssetRow` component uses several utility functions and libraries, including `toast` from the `react-toastify` library, which is used to display toast messages to the user; `groupedNumberFormatter` and `usdFormatter` from the `~/utils/formatters` module, which are used to format numbers and currency values; and various functions from the `@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common/src/spl` and `@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common` modules, which are used to create and manage associated token accounts and perform various Solana transactions.\n\nThe `AssetRow` component is responsible for handling user interactions with the asset row, such as clicking the action button to borrow or lend the asset, entering an amount to borrow or lend, and refreshing the user's bank information. When the user clicks the action button, the component performs various checks to ensure that the user has entered a valid amount and that the user has the necessary funds to perform the action. If the checks pass, the component creates a Marginfi account for the user (if one does not already exist) and performs the relevant Solana transaction (e.g., deposit, withdraw, borrow, or repay). The component then updates the user's bank information and displays a toast message to the user indicating whether the transaction was successful or not.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a React functional component called `AssetRow` that renders a table row for a specific bank asset. It also includes helper functions to determine the current action (deposit, withdraw, borrow, or repay) based on the user's lending mode and the bank's current position.\n\n2. What external libraries or APIs does this code use?\n- This code imports several libraries and APIs, including Material-UI, React, React Toastify, Solana Web3.js, and Marginfi Client v2. It also imports helper functions from the `mrgn-common` package.\n\n3. What are some potential error scenarios that this code handles?\n- This code handles several potential error scenarios, such as when the user tries to deposit or borrow an amount of 0, when the user doesn't have any tokens to lend or can't borrow any tokens, and when there is an error creating or accessing the Marginfi account. It also handles errors related to performing the relevant operation (deposit, borrow, repay, or withdraw) and reloading the state. The code displays error messages using React Toastify."

      "summary": "The code above is a TypeScript module that exports a React functional component called `AssetRowAction`. This component is responsible for rendering a button that can be used to perform an action related to an asset. The component uses the Material-UI library to create the button and the Solana Wallet Adapter React library to interact with a Solana wallet.\n\nThe `AssetRowAction` component takes in a set of props that are passed down to the underlying `Button` component. These props include the `children` prop, which is used to render the text inside the button, and the `disabled` prop, which is used to disable the button if it cannot be clicked. The component also accepts any other props that can be passed to a Material-UI `Button`.\n\nThe `useWallet` hook from the Solana Wallet Adapter React library is used to get the current state of the wallet. If the wallet is connected, the component renders a `Button` with the specified styles and props. If the wallet is not connected, the component renders a dynamic `WalletMultiButton` component from the `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` library. This component is used to display a button that can be clicked to connect the wallet.\n\nThe `WalletMultiButtonDynamic` component is loaded dynamically using the `dynamic` function from the Next.js library. This ensures that the component is only loaded on the client-side and not during server-side rendering. This is important because the Solana Wallet Adapter React library requires access to the window object, which is not available during server-side rendering.\n\nOverall, the `AssetRowAction` component is a reusable component that can be used throughout the mrgn-ts project to render buttons that interact with a Solana wallet. The component is flexible and can be customized using the props passed to it.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useWallet` hook from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`?\n- The `useWallet` hook is used to access the Solana wallet connection state within the `AssetRowAction` component.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `WalletMultiButtonDynamic` component?\n- The `WalletMultiButtonDynamic` component is a dynamically loaded component from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` that renders a button for connecting to a Solana wallet.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `AssetRowAction` component?\n- The `AssetRowAction` component is a custom button component that conditionally renders either a regular button or the `WalletMultiButtonDynamic` component based on the state of the Solana wallet connection."

It then conditionally renders a div containing the text \"Current APY\" (only visible on larger screens) and another div containing the asset's APY percentage, formatted using a utility function called `percentFormatter`. The background color and text color of this div depend on whether the asset is in lending mode or not.\n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that displays information about various financial assets, such as a portfolio management dashboard or investment tracking app. It could be used in conjunction with other components to create a table or list of assets, with each row containing an `AssetRowHeader` cell and additional cells for other information such as current price, market cap, or trading volume.

The `NumericFormat` component also provides input validation to ensure that the user only enters valid numbers.\n\nThe `AssetRowInputBox` component adds some custom styling to the input field using the `TextField` component from the `@mui/material` library. It also adds an input adornment to the right side of the input field that displays the text \"max\" and can be clicked to set the input value to the maximum allowed value.

The outermost `div` has a class that sets the background color, border, height, width, and padding of the component. The `borderRadius` prop is used to set the border radius of the component. The `fontFamily` and `fontWeight` styles are also set for the component.\n\nInside the outermost `div`, there are three nested `div` elements.
