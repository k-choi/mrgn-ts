  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `AssetRowMetric` that takes in several props and returns a JSX element. The purpose of this component is to render a row of metrics for an asset, such as a cryptocurrency or stock. The component takes in the following props:\n\n- `shortLabel`: a string representing a short label for the metric\n- `longLabel`: a string representing a longer label for the metric\n- `value`: a string representing the value of the metric\n- `borderRadius`: a string representing the border radius of the component\n- `usdEquivalentValue` (optional): a string representing the USD equivalent value of the metric\n\nThe component returns a `div` element with several nested `div` elements inside. The outermost `div` has a class that sets the background color, border, height, width, and padding of the component. The `borderRadius` prop is used to set the border radius of the component. The `fontFamily` and `fontWeight` styles are also set for the component.\n\nInside the outermost `div`, there are three nested `div` elements. The first `div` element is hidden on extra-large screens and displays the `longLabel` prop. The second `div` element is hidden on small screens and displays the `shortLabel` prop. The third `div` element displays the `value` prop. If the `usdEquivalentValue` prop is defined, a fourth `div` element is also rendered that displays the `usdEquivalentValue` prop.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display metrics for various assets in a consistent and visually appealing way. Here is an example of how the component can be used:\n\n```\n<AssetRowMetric\n  shortLabel=\"BTC\"\n  longLabel=\"Bitcoin\"\n  value=\"50,000\"\n  borderRadius=\"8px\"\n  usdEquivalentValue=\"$2,500,000\"\n/>\n```\n\nThis would render a row of metrics for Bitcoin with a short label of \"BTC\", a long label of \"Bitcoin\", a value of \"50,000\", and a USD equivalent value of \"$2,500,000\". The component would have a border radius of 8 pixels.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React functional component called `AssetRowMetric` that renders a styled div containing some text and an optional USD equivalent value.\n\n2. What props does the `AssetRowMetric` component accept?\n- The `AssetRowMetric` component accepts five props: `shortLabel` (string), `longLabel` (string), `value` (string), `borderRadius` (string), and `usdEquivalentValue` (optional string).\n\n3. What styling is applied to the rendered div?\n- The rendered div has a black semi-transparent background, a solid border with a dark gray color, a height of 12 pixels, a full width that can be constrained to a maximum of 200 pixels, and some padding. The border radius and font family are customizable through props, and the font weight is fixed at 400. The text color is light gray, except for the USD equivalent value, which has a white text color and a light blue background color. The USD equivalent value is only displayed if the `usdEquivalentValue` prop is defined."
