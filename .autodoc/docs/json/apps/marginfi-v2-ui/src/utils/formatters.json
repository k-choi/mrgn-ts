  "summary": "This file contains several instances of the Intl.NumberFormat class, which is used for formatting numbers according to a specific locale. The purpose of this code is to provide pre-configured number formatters for use throughout the larger mrgn-ts project.\n\nThe first two instances, groupedNumberFormatter and groupedNumberFormatterDyn, format numbers with grouping separators (e.g. commas) and a fixed number of decimal places. The difference between the two is that groupedNumberFormatterDyn allows for a variable number of decimal places, while groupedNumberFormatter always displays two decimal places.\n\nThe next instance, usdFormatter, formats numbers as US dollars with a currency symbol and a fixed number of decimal places. This formatter is useful for displaying monetary values in a standardized way.\n\nThe final two instances, percentFormatter and percentFormatterDyn, format numbers as percentages with a fixed or variable number of decimal places. These formatters are useful for displaying percentages in a standardized way.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of pre-configured number formatters that can be used throughout the mrgn-ts project to ensure consistent formatting of numbers, currencies, and percentages. Here is an example of how these formatters might be used:\n\n```\nimport { usdFormatter, percentFormatter } from 'mrgn-ts';\n\nconst revenue = 12345.67;\nconst growthRate = 0.1234;\n\nconsole.log(usdFormatter.format(revenue)); // \"$12,345.67\"\nconsole.log(percentFormatter.format(growthRate)); // \"12.34%\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code exports several instances of the Intl.NumberFormat class with different configurations for formatting numbers and currencies in the en-US locale.\n\n2. What are the differences between the various formatters?\n   The formatters differ in their style (currency or percent), the number of minimum and maximum fraction digits, and whether or not they use grouping separators.\n\n3. Can these formatters be used for other locales besides en-US?\n   Yes, the Intl.NumberFormat class supports formatting for different locales by passing the locale code as the first argument to the constructor. However, this code specifically configures the formatters for the en-US locale."
