      "summary": "This code is a license for a font called \"Plex\" that is being used in the mrgn-ts project. The license is the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, which allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified, and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n\nThis license is important for the mrgn-ts project because it ensures that the font being used is licensed appropriately and can be used freely without any legal issues. It also allows for modifications to be made to the font if necessary, which can be useful for customizing the font to fit the needs of the project.\n\nExample usage of this license in the mrgn-ts project would be to include the license file in the project's repository and ensure that any use of the \"Plex\" font follows the guidelines outlined in the license. This can be done by including the copyright notice and license in any documentation or code that uses the font, and ensuring that any modifications made to the font are done in accordance with the license.",

  "summary": "The folder `.autodoc/docs/json/apps/marginfi-v2-ui/src/assets/IBM_Plex_Mono` contains the IBM Plex Mono font files that are being used in the mrgn-ts project. The font files are stored in various formats such as .woff, .woff2, .ttf, and .eot.\n\nThe IBM Plex Mono font is a monospaced font that is designed for use in coding environments. It is a part of the IBM Plex font family, which is an open-source font family that is designed to be used in various applications such as web, desktop, and mobile.\n\nIn the mrgn-ts project, the IBM Plex Mono font is being used to display code snippets and other programming-related content. The font is being loaded into the project using CSS, and the various font files are being referenced in the CSS file.\n\nHere is an example of how the IBM Plex Mono font might be used in the mrgn-ts project:\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono';\n  src: url('assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Regular.eot');\n  src: url('assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Regular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\n       url('assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'),\n       url('assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Regular.woff') format('woff'),\n       url('assets/IBM_Plex_Mono/IBMPlexMono-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');\n  font-weight: normal;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n\ncode {\n  font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `@font-face` rule is used to define the IBM Plex Mono font family and reference the various font files. The `code` element is then styled to use the IBM Plex Mono font family.\n\nOverall, the IBM Plex Mono font files in this folder are an important part of the mrgn-ts project as they are used to display code snippets and other programming-related content. The font files are loaded into the project using CSS, and the various font formats ensure that the font is displayed correctly across various browsers and devices.",
