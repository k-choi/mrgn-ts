  "summary": "The folder `.autodoc/docs/json/apps/marginfi-v2-ui/src/assets/IBM_Plex_Sans` contains the font files for the IBM Plex Sans font, which is being used in the mrgn-ts project. The `OFL.txt` file in this folder contains the license for this font, which is the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.\n\nThe IBM Plex Sans font is a sans-serif font that was designed by IBM and released under the SIL Open Font License. It is a versatile font that can be used for a variety of purposes, including headings, body text, and captions. The font files in this folder include the regular, bold, italic, and bold italic versions of the font in both TrueType and OpenType formats.\n\nIn the context of the mrgn-ts project, the IBM Plex Sans font is being used to provide a consistent and professional look and feel to the user interface. The font is being used in various places throughout the project, including headings, labels, and buttons. By using a consistent font throughout the project, the user interface is easier to read and more visually appealing.\n\nTo use the IBM Plex Sans font in the mrgn-ts project, developers can include the font files in the project's assets folder and reference them in the project's CSS files. For example, to use the regular version of the font in a heading, the following CSS code could be used:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n  font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\nThis code sets the font family to 'IBM Plex Sans' and the font weight to 400, which corresponds to the regular version of the font. Similar code could be used to reference the other versions of the font.\n\nIn summary, the `.autodoc/docs/json/apps/marginfi-v2-ui/src/assets/IBM_Plex_Sans` folder contains the font files for the IBM Plex Sans font, which is being used in the mrgn-ts project to provide a consistent and professional look and feel to the user interface.
