  "summary": "The code defines a React context and provider for managing state related to banks. The `BanksStateProvider` component is a wrapper around its children that provides state and functions related to banks to its descendants via the `BanksContext`. The state includes whether data is currently being fetched (`fetching`), an array of `Bank` objects (`banks`), and an array of `BankInfo` objects (`bankInfos`). The `reload` function is used to update the state with fresh data from the server.\n\nThe `useBanks` hook is provided to allow components to easily access the state and functions provided by the `BanksStateProvider`. If a component tries to use `useBanks` outside of a `BanksStateProvider`, an error is thrown.\n\nThe `BanksStateProvider` component uses the `useProgram` and `useTokenMetadata` hooks to get the necessary data to fetch bank information. The `useProgram` hook provides access to the `mfiClientReadonly` object, which is used to fetch bank data. The `useTokenMetadata` hook provides access to a map of token metadata, which is used to create `BankInfo` objects.\n\nThe `reload` function is called when the component mounts and every 60 seconds thereafter. It fetches bank data from the server using the `mfiClientReadonly.group.reload()` method, which returns a `Map` of `Bank` objects. The `banks` state is set to an array of the `Bank` objects, and the `bankInfos` state is set to an array of `BankInfo` objects created from the `Bank` objects and token metadata. If an error occurs during the fetch, a toast message is displayed.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way for components to access and manage state related to banks, including fetching and updating bank data from the server. It is likely used in conjunction with other components and hooks to provide a complete user interface for interacting with bank data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides a context and hooks for managing bank information in a React application, including fetching and reloading bank data from an API.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies, including React, the \"@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2\" package, the \"react-toastify\" package, and custom hooks from other files in the project.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"useEffect\" hook in this code?\n- There are two \"useEffect\" hooks in this code. The first one runs once on component mount and sets up the initial bank data. The second one runs on component mount and every 60 seconds thereafter, and updates the bank data."
