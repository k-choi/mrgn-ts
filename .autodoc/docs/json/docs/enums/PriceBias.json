  "summary": "The code provided is an HTML file that serves as documentation for the `PriceBias` enumeration in the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` module of the `mrgn-ts` project. The purpose of this file is to provide information about the different members of the `PriceBias` enumeration, including their names and values, as well as their source locations within the `bank.ts` file of the `marginfi-client-v2` module.\n\nThe file contains several HTML elements, including a `head` element that defines the metadata for the page, such as the character set, title, and description. The `body` element contains the main content of the page, which is divided into several sections. The `header` element contains a toolbar with search and filter options, as well as a breadcrumb trail that shows the user's current location within the module. The `container-main` element contains the main content of the page, which is divided into two columns. The left column contains an index of the enumeration members, while the right column contains detailed information about each member.\n\nThe `PriceBias` enumeration has three members: `Highest`, `Lowest`, and `None`. Each member is defined as an enum member with a name and a value, and is accompanied by a source location that indicates where it is defined within the `bank.ts` file. The `Lowest` member has a value of 0, the `None` member has a value of 1, and the `Highest` member has a value of 2.\n\nThis file is intended to be used as a reference for developers who are working with the `PriceBias` enumeration in the `marginfi-client-v2` module. It provides a clear and concise overview of the different members of the enumeration, as well as their values and source locations. Developers can use this information to understand how the `PriceBias` enumeration is used within the module, and to write code that interacts with it correctly.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { PriceBias } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';\n\n// Use the Lowest member of the PriceBias enumeration\nconst bias = PriceBias.Lowest;\n\n// Use a switch statement to handle different members of the enumeration\nswitch (bias) {\n  case PriceBias.Highest:\n    console.log('Highest bias');\n    break;\n  case PriceBias.Lowest:\n    console.log('Lowest bias');\n    break;\n  case PriceBias.None:\n    console.log('No bias');\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log('Unknown bias');\n}\n```",
