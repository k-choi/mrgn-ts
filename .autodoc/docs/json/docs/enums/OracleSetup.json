  "summary": "The code is an HTML file that serves as documentation for the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project. It contains information about the `OracleSetup` enumeration, including its members and their values. The file also includes a search bar, a navigation menu, and a legend that explains the icons used in the documentation.\n\nThis file is important for the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project because it provides developers with a clear understanding of the `OracleSetup` enumeration and its members. Developers can use this information to write code that interacts with the enumeration in a meaningful way. For example, a developer might use the `None` member to represent a null value in their code, or they might use the `Pyth` member to represent a Python script.\n\nThe search bar and navigation menu make it easy for developers to find the information they need quickly. The legend helps developers understand the different icons used in the documentation, which can be useful when reading through the code.\n\nOverall, this HTML file is an important part of the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project because it provides developers with clear and concise documentation about the `OracleSetup` enumeration. This documentation can help developers write better code and avoid errors when working with the enumeration.",
