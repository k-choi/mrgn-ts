      "summary": "The code is an HTML file that serves as documentation for the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project. The file contains information about the `AccountType` enumeration, which is defined in the `types.ts` file of the project. \n\nThe HTML file includes a header with a search bar and a menu, a title, and a container with two sections. The first section is an index of the enumeration members, which includes two items: `MarginfiAccount` and `MarginfiGroup`. The second section is a list of the enumeration members with their corresponding values. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide documentation for developers who are using the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project. The `AccountType` enumeration is used to define the type of account or group in the Marginfi system. Developers can use this enumeration to specify the type of account or group when making requests to the Marginfi API. \n\nHere is an example of how the `AccountType` enumeration can be used in the project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AccountType } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';\n\nconst accountType = AccountType.MarginfiAccount;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountType` enumeration is imported from the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` package. The `MarginfiAccount` member is then assigned to the `accountType` variable. \n\nOverall, this HTML file provides important information about the `AccountType` enumeration in the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project, which is used to specify the type of account or group in the Marginfi system.",

  "summary": "The `enums` folder in the `docs` directory of the `mrgn-ts` project contains several HTML files that serve as documentation for different enumerations used in the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` package. These enumerations are used to define different types of accounts, groups, vaults, and biases in the Marginfi system.\n\nEach HTML file provides a clear and organized overview of the different members of the enumeration, as well as their values and source locations. The files also include search bars, navigation menus, and legends that help developers find the information they need quickly and understand the different icons used in the documentation.\n\nFor example, the `AccountType.html` file provides documentation for the `AccountType` enumeration, which is used to specify the type of account or group in the Marginfi system. Developers can use this enumeration to define the type of account or group when making requests to the Marginfi API. Here is an example of how the `AccountType` enumeration can be used in the project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AccountType } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';\n\nconst accountType = AccountType.MarginfiAccount;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountType` enumeration is imported from the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` package.
