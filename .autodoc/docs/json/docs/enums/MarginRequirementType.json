The purpose of this file is to provide information about the different members of the `MarginRequirementType` enumeration, including their names and values, as well as their source locations within the `account.ts` file of the `marginfi-client-v2` package.\n\nThe file contains a header section with metadata about the document, including the title, description, and viewport settings. It also includes links to external CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality. The body of the document is divided into several sections, including a page toolbar, page title, container for the main content, and a footer.\n\nThe main content of the document is divided into two sections: an index group and a member group. The index group provides a list of all the members of the `MarginRequirementType` enumeration, while the member group provides detailed information about each member, including its name, value, and source location. Each member is represented as an HTML section with a unique ID, and includes a link to its source location in the `account.ts` file.\n\nThe document also includes a legend section that provides information about the different icons used to represent different kinds of members, such as constructors, properties, and methods. Additionally, the document includes a settings section that allows the user to select a theme for the documentation.\n\nOverall, this HTML file serves as a useful reference for developers who are working with the `MarginRequirementType` enumeration in the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` package of the `mrgn-ts` project.
