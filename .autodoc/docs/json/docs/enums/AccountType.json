  "summary": "The code is an HTML file that serves as documentation for the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project. The file contains information about the `AccountType` enumeration, which is defined in the `types.ts` file of the project. \n\nThe HTML file includes a header with a search bar and a menu, a title, and a container with two sections. The first section is an index of the enumeration members, which includes two items: `MarginfiAccount` and `MarginfiGroup`. The second section is a list of the enumeration members with their corresponding values. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide documentation for developers who are using the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project. The `AccountType` enumeration is used to define the type of account or group in the Marginfi system. Developers can use this enumeration to specify the type of account or group when making requests to the Marginfi API. \n\nHere is an example of how the `AccountType` enumeration can be used in the project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AccountType } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';\n\nconst accountType = AccountType.MarginfiAccount;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountType` enumeration is imported from the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` package. The `MarginfiAccount` member is then assigned to the `accountType` variable. \n\nOverall, this HTML file provides important information about the `AccountType` enumeration in the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` project, which is used to specify the type of account or group in the Marginfi system.",
